# Animal-Crossing-Dates
This program gets today's date and shows you events that are happening in the future regarding Animal Crossing: New Leaf.

I wrote this in anticipation of New Horizons, and it holds all of the necessary information in the program itself.

The way I wrote it is very primitive but the point is that the program works as intended (as far as I know).

I also wrote this in a week or so during my overnight tech support shifts.
